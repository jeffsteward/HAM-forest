# HAM-forest

## The idea
* Let’s grow a digital forest based on the properties of the art in our collections
* Let’s give people the ability to hack up art to create a seed packet, then plant those seeds in an ecosystem
* It’s going to be collaborative
* It’s going to be constantly changing
* It’s going to force people to see art through a new perspective
* There will be no immediate gratification (after all trees take a long time to grow)
